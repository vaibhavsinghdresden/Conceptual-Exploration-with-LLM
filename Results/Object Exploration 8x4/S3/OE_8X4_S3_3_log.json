This meaning is also shared by 'English: divide', 'Russian: delit'sya', 'English: split', 'English: separate', and 'Russian: razluchat''. However, 'Russian: razbivat'' does not share this meaning as it generally means to break or smash something into pieces, which is a physical action and does not involve giving or supporting.",
                    "example": "For example, 'I will share my food with you' (English: share), 'ya budu delit' svoi obed s toboi' (Russian: delit'), 'I will divide my time between work and study' (English: divide), 'ya budu delit'sya svoim vremyen' mezhdu rabotoi i izucheniem' (Russian: delit'sya), 'I will split the bill with you' (English: split), 'I will separate the laundry before washing' (English: separate), 'ya budu razluchat' belye i tsvetnye things' (Russian: razluchat'). But 'Russian: razbivat'' would mean 'I will break the glass' (ya budu razbivat' steklo)."
