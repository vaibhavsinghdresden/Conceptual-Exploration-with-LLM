                    "explanation": "The word 'English: divide' can mean to extend or stretch something, 'English: separate' can imply a physical separation which can involve extending, 'Russian: razluchat'' means to separate or part, which can involve extending or moving apart, 'Russian: razbivat'' means to break or smash, but can also imply spreading out, 'English: share' can involve extending or giving out portions, 'Russian: delit'' means to divide or share, which can involve extending, and 'English: split' can mean to divide or separate, which can also involve extending. However, 'Russian: delit''sya' generally means to divide oneself or share oneself and does not typically involve the meaning of extending or stretching something. 'Russian: delit''sya' is a reflexive verb that focuses on the subject performing the action on itself, which limits its applicability to the meaning of extending or stretching something.",
                    "example": "For example, 'English: divide' can be used as 'The farmer will divide the land to extend the farm', 'English: separate' as 'The couple will separate and extend their search for a new home', 'Russian: razluchat'' as 'Oni razluchatsya, potomu chto oni perestali ponimat' drug druga i nashli novye interesy', 'Russian: razbivat'' as 'On razbival stol, chtoby ras\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c ego', 'English: share' as 'She will share the cake and extend the invitation', 'Russian: delit'' as 'On delit svoyu zemlyu, chtoby ras\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c svoyu fermerstvo', and 'English: split' as 'They will split the wood to extend the fence'. However, 'Russian: delit''sya' would not fit these examples as it does not convey the meaning of extending or stretching something."
