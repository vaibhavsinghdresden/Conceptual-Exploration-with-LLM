                    "explanation": "The word 'separate' is taken from English and generally means to move or force something to move apart. The word 'razluchat'' is taken from Russian and generally means to detach or disengage. The word 'split' is taken from English and generally means to divide a single physical object into constituent parts. The word 'delit'sya' is taken from Russian and generally means to isolate constituent parts of a non-physical object. The word 'razbivat'' is taken from Russian and generally means to break or shatter something into pieces. The word 'delit'' is taken from Russian and generally means to divide a set of elements into groups. The word 'divide' is taken from English and generally means to distinguish or differentiate. All these words share the meaning 'to depart or leave a place' but 'English: share' does not share this meaning.",
                    "example": "For example, 'I am going to separate from my friends and leave the party' (English: separate), 'On razluchilsya so mnoi' meaning 'He departed from me' (Russian: razluchat'), 'The group split up and left the room' (English: split), 'Oni delilis' meaning 'They departed' (Russian: delit'sya), 'On razbival komnatu' meaning 'He left the room' (Russian: razbivat'), 'Oni delilis' meaning 'They departed' (Russian: delit'), 'The team will divide and leave the field' (English: divide). But 'English: share' does not have this meaning, for example, 'I will share this cake with you' does not mean to depart or leave a place."
