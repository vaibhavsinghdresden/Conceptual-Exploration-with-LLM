The word 'Russian: razbivat'' can imply departing or leaving a place, often with force or suddenness. The word 'English: divide' can imply departing or leaving a place, often in a sense of separating or parting ways. The word 'Russian: razluchat'' can imply departing or leaving a place, often in a sense of separating or parting ways. The word 'English: separate' can also imply departing or leaving a place, often in a sense of dividing or parting ways. However, 'Russian: delit'sya' generally means to divide oneself, often in a reflexive sense, and does not share the meaning 'to depart or leave a place' with the other words.",
                    "example": "For example, 'English: split' can be used as 'The group split up and left the party.' 'English: share' can be used as 'They shared a cab to depart the city.' 'Russian: delit'' can be used as 'Oni delilis i ushli' (They parted and left). 'Russian: razbivat'' can be used as 'On razbival ot goloda' (He departed due to hunger). 'English: divide' can be used as 'The group divided and left the party.' 'Russian: razluchat'' can be used as 'Oni razluchilis i ushli' (They parted and left). 'English: separate' can be used as 'They separated and left the party.' However, 'Russian: delit'sya' would not be used in this context, as it implies a reflexive action, such as 'On delilsya s drugom' (He shared with his friend), but not departing a place."
