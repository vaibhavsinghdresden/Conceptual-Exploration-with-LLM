Similarly, 'divide' can mean to separate or part something, but in some contexts, it can also imply participation. The Russian words 'razluchat'' and 'delit'' also convey the idea of separation, which can sometimes be related to participation. The English word 'split' can also imply separation, but in some cases, it can mean to divide something into parts to participate. However, 'Russian: delit'sya' does not share this meaning of participation, as it generally means to divide or separate something into parts, without the connotation of taking part in something.",
                    "example": "For example, 'I will share the experience with my friends' (English: share), 'The company will divide the profits among the shareholders' (English: divide), 'The couple decided to separate and go their own ways' (English: separate), 'Oni razluchilis' nachalo svad'by' (Russian: razluchat', meaning they separated at the beginning of the wedding), 'Ya delil tort na dva kuska' (Russian: delit', meaning I divided the cake into two pieces), 'The tree branch split into two during the storm' (English: split). But 'delit'sya' in Russian means 'to divide oneself', which doesn't necessarily imply participation, for instance, 'Ya delilsya svoyim opytom' (meaning I shared my experience, but 'delit'sya' here is more about dividing one's own experience rather than participating in something)."
