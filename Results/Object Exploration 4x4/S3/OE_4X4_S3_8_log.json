However, 'English: separate' does not share this meaning. The general meaning of 'English: share' is to give or receive a part of something. 'English: split' generally means to divide something into parts. 'English: divide' generally means to separate or part something into pieces. All of these words are from the English language.",

'I will split the bill with you' means dividing the bill into parts and giving one part to somebody else. 'I will divide the work among you' means separating the work into parts and giving each part to somebody else. However, 'I will separate the boys from the girls' does not mean giving part of something to somebody else, it means isolating them."
