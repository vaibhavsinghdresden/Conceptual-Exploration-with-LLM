The word 'split' can also mean to divide something into parts and give or share it with others. Similarly, 'divide' can imply sharing or distributing something among people. However, 'separate' typically means to keep or put things apart, and does not inherently imply giving or sharing. The word 'separate' is taken from the English language.",
