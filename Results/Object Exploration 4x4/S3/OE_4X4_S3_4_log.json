This meaning is not shared by 'English: separate'. The general meaning of 'English: split' is to divide something into parts or to separate things. The general meaning of 'English: share' is to give a portion of something to someone. The general meaning of 'English: divide' is to separate something into parts or to give a portion of something to someone. All these words are from the English language.",

'I will share my toys with you' means to give a portion of the toys to someone. 'I will divide the money between us' means to give a portion of the money to someone. However, 'I will separate the dogs' does not mean to give a portion of something to someone, it means to isolate them."
