The word 'English: share' generally means to give or receive a part of something. The word 'English: split' can also mean to divide something into parts and give or share them. The word 'English: divide' can also imply giving or sharing parts of something. However, 'English: separate' generally means to isolate or detach, and does not necessarily imply giving or sharing. The general meaning of 'English: share' and 'English: split' and 'English: divide' is to partition or apportion something, whereas 'English: separate' means to disconnect or detach.",
                    "example": "For example, 'I will share my cake with you' means giving part of the cake to somebody else. 'I will split the bill with you' means dividing the bill into parts and giving or sharing them. 'I will divide the land among my children' means giving parts of the land to each child. However, 'I will separate the dogs' means isolating or detaching them from each other, without necessarily giving or sharing anything."
