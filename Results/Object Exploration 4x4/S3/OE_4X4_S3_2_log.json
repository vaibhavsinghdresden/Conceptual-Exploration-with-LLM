                    "explanation": "The word 'split' generally means to divide something into parts or to separate things. It is taken from the English language. The word 'share' generally means to give a part of something to somebody or to have or use something at the same time as someone else. It is also taken from the English language. The meaning 'to give a part of something to somebody' is shared by 'split' and 'share' but not by 'separate' or 'divide' in this context. 'Separate' generally means to keep or put things apart, and 'divide' generally means to separate or part things. Both 'separate' and 'divide' are also taken from the English language.",

However, 'I will separate the cake' does not mean to give a part of the cake to somebody, and 'I will divide the cake' in this context means to separate the cake into parts but does not necessarily imply giving it to somebody."

However, 'separate' does not typically have this meaning. 'Separate' generally means to keep or put things apart, whereas 'split', 'divide', and 'share' can all imply a sense of dispersal or distribution.",
