It can be used to isolate constituent parts of a non-physical object, like a concept or idea, into smaller parts. It can also be used to distribute among themselves, like a group of people fracturing into smaller subgroups. Additionally, it can mark the boundary between two things, cause things to move or be apart, and distribute among others, like a company fracturing its assets among its shareholders. However, 'fracture' does not convey the meanings 'divide a single physical object into constituent parts' or 'divide a set of elements into groups' in the classical sense, as it typically implies a breaking or separation rather than a division into equal or organized parts.",
                    "example": "The team's idea began to fracture into smaller, more manageable parts as they worked on the project. The company will fracture its assets among its shareholders. The new policy will fracture the community, causing some to move away. The teacher helped the students fracture the complex problem into smaller, more solvable parts, and then they distributed the tasks among themselves."
