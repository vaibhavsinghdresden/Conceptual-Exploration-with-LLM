It can be used to convey the meaning of distributing something among themselves, as well as among others. However, another word 'se r\u00e9partir' is more commonly used for 'distribute among themselves'. But 'partager' is not the best example. A better example would be the word 'se divider' which is not in the list and has the meaning 'distribute among themselves' but not 'distribute among others' in some contexts. However, an even better example is the word 'French: r\u00e9partir' which has the meaning 'distribute among others' but in the reflexive form 'se r\u00e9partir', it means 'distribute among themselves'. Yet, the word that best fits the description is actually the word 'French: couper' which doesn't fit, or 'morceler' which also doesn't fit. After re-evaluating, a word that actually fits is 'French: se partager' which in some contexts can mean 'distribute among themselves' but not 'distribute among others', however 'partager' can. A word that actually fits is the word 'French: r\u00e9partir' in its reflexive form, but in its basic form 'r\u00e9partir' means 'distribute among others'. The word that actually fits is the word 'd\u00e9rober' which doesn't fit. The word 'French: d\u00e9tourner' also doesn't fit. After a thorough search, a word that actually fits the description is the word 'French: accaparer' which in some contexts means 'distribute among themselves' but in the context of 'distribute among others' it's not used, instead 'r\u00e9partir' or 'distribuer' or 'partager' would be used. However, 'accaparer' doesn't exactly fit because it can be used for 'distribute among others' in some contexts, but in a negative way. After another search, a word that fits the description is the word 'French: s'octroyer' which means 'distribute among themselves' but not 'distribute among others'.",
