It can be used to isolate constituent parts of a non-physical object, such as shredding a document to separate its contents. It can also be used to put something into containers, like shredding paper to put it into a recycling bin. Additionally, 'shred' can cause something to move or be apart, as in shredding a tire, which causes it to come apart. Lastly, 'shred' can divide a single physical object into constituent parts, like shredding cheese into smaller pieces. However, 'shred' does not typically convey the meaning of distributing something among others.",
